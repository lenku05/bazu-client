      As a first born from a humble background, ‘The Bazu’ had to start his
      hustle life immediately after his secondary education, as flamboyant as he
      appears today, Bazu’s first job was a toilet cleaner at the Serena Hotel
      in Nairobi. Two years in as Toilet Cleaner he was promoted to Room
      Service, cleaning rooms and making beds for guests. He utilized this new
      position quiet well by interacting with guests and staff, he had an
      impeccable knowledge of the Queens language for an employee his position.
      A few interactions and he got promoted to be a telephone operator at the
      reception doubling up as a cashier. His sociable nature led to his
      election to serve as a committee member of the Serena Staff Sacco; later
      elected as Vice chairman and Eventually chairman of the Sacco. A taste of
      leadership at the Sacco only elevated his desire for leadership. He quit
      his job at Serena in 2006 to contest the Ololopon Councilors Seat on an
      ODM ticket in Kajiado South in the 2007 elections which he lost. The loss
      brought him back to the hospitality industry, this was an easy application
      for him as he had been voted the best employee in Serena. He got a job as
      a cashier at Sarova Panafric and worked for two years before setting up
      his hospitality business – Choma Zone - in Kajiado Town. He later on
      diversified to real estate and properties business creating Across Kenya
      Safaris Company offering Outside Catering and event Management. This is
      where his financial status grew and he even got money to support his
      Olalarashi – Olgulului Group Ranch campaigns. Two years in he has
      implemented a previously not thought possible peaceful subdivision of
      about 150,000 acres of Ranch Land. 90% of members allocated their pieces
